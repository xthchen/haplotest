\title{Adapted CMH test if starting frequencies are known, other frequencies estimated with sampling variances.}
\usage{
adapted.cmh.test.str.true(freq, Ne, gen, cov, repli)
}
\arguments{
\item{freq}{Numeric matrix of frequencies, with the row being the haplotype/SNP, and column being the sequenced time points.}

\item{Ne}{Numeric vector with length as number of replicates, containing information of Ne (effective population size) at each replicated population. If Ne changes over time, take as input a numeric matrix, with the column being the replicate position, row being the Ne at each sequenced time points.}

\item{gen}{Numeric vector of sequenced time points.}

\item{cov}{Numeric matrix of sample size, with the row being the haplotype/SNP, and column being the sequenced time points.}

\item{repli}{Numeric, specifying the number of replicated populations.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector, p-values from the hypothesis test
}
\description{
This function performs the adapted CMH test (Spitzer et al. 2019), but in cases where the starting frequencies are known, and other frequencies estimated with sampling variances. Drift variance and sampling variance are taken into account for all none starting frequencies in this test.
